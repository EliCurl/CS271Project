# CS271 Project

We create a project that creates a mario party style board!
We use NFAs to create these boards and to check what color they should be!
We do this by checking what transition the tile should have, either main path or a branching path that may lead to a pipe or wrap-around path.
We also use them to determine the color that each tile is, whether it be blue, red, event, star, etc.
